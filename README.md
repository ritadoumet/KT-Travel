# KT-Travel
Front-End project representing a fictional travel agency.

K&T Travel.html is a file containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of the main page. The main page has a gallery of images, a sidebar, a smoothly changing background, a booking form, and links to other parts of the project. 

tour.html is a file containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of the tours offered by K&T Travel. Several tours are offered in the top navigation pane, and when clicked, a description of each opens and the user is able to go to the booking section and select the options.

rateUs is a file containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of the rating page. This page is basic, as it allows the user to post a rating of both of the above-mentioned pages. The user is able to post a star rating, post a comment, and change the style of the font. 

All three pages are highly interactive and use form validation.
